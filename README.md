# Spatial Trend Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis scripts for conducting spatial trend analysis, focusing on the `trend.csv` dataset. The aim is to identify, visualize, and understand the trends within spatial data over time.

## Dataset

The `trend.csv` file is central to our analysis. It includes spatial data points across various locations and times, allowing for a comprehensive study of how certain phenomena change geographically and temporally.

### Structure

The `trend.csv` file follows this general structure:

- **LocationID**: Unique identifier for the location.
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the location.
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the location.
- **Year**: The date of the observation.
- **Annual**: The observed value (e.g., temperature from 1984-2022) at the location and date.

## Analysis

The analysis aims to uncover patterns within the spatial data, such as areas of significant increase or decrease in the observed values over time. 

### Tools and Libraries

The analysis scripts are written in Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for any statistical modeling or machine learning tasks. Jupyter Notebooks are used to document the analysis steps, findings, and visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spatial-trend-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**

   Navigate to the notebook directory and start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
   ```
   cd notebooks
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Run the Analysis**

   Open the analysis notebooks and run the cells to perform the spatial trend analysis on the `trend.csv` data.

## Contributing

Contributions to the analysis or dataset are welcome. Whether it's adding new data, improving the analysis scripts, or fixing bugs, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
